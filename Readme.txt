This python script was used to collate managerial appointment and termination dates for English clubs as recorded in the League Manager's Association (LMA) website: www.leaguemanagers.com. Please note that the site format has recently changed and so the current script is deprecated (this will be updated soon).

The data collected is provided in engmanagers.csv.
